# NLP-Sentiment-Analysis-Airline-Tweets-with-BERT
This repository showcases a sentiment analysis project utilizing BERT, a leading NLP model. The project involves preprocessing, tokenization, and fine-tuning BERT for sentiment classification of airline tweets.

## Overview

This project is an implementation of sentiment analysis for airline-related tweets using BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers). Sentiment analysis, a subfield of Natural Language Processing (NLP), involves classifying text data into sentiment categories, such as positive, negative, or neutral. BERT, a state-of-the-art NLP model, is leveraged for its ability to capture contextual information effectively.

The project includes text preprocessing, tokenization, fine-tuning, and evaluation to categorize airline tweets based on sentiment. It showcases proficiency in NLP, deep learning, and text analysis.

## Key Components

- **Text Preprocessing**: Text data is cleaned, removing punctuation, numbers, and stop words. Additionally, lemmatization and lowercasing are applied to enhance data quality.

- **Tokenization**: The BERT model tokenizes text data, allowing it to represent words and subwords efficiently.

-  **Fine-Tuning**: A pre-trained BERT model is fine-tuned on airline tweet data for sentiment analysis.

- **Evaluation**: Model performance is assessed on a test dataset, demonstrating its ability to generalize to new, unseen data.
